## Ways to Contribute

**Report Bugs**
- Search existing issues to avoid duplicates
- Create a minimal reproduction
- Include environment details (React Native version, platform, etc.)

**Suggest Features** 
- Check if already requested in GitHub issues
- Describe the use case and value
- Provide examples or mockups

**Submit Code**
- Fork the repository
- Create a feature branch
- Test thoroughly on both platforms
- Submit a pull request

## Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ogulcanbagatir/rn-animated-components.git
   ```

2. **Create test environment**
   ```bash
   npx create-expo-app test-app
   cd test-app
   npx expo install react-native-reanimated @shopify/react-native-skia react-native-gesture-handler
   ```

3. **Copy component for testing**
   Copy the component you want to work on into your test app.

## Component Guidelines

**Code Style**
- Use TypeScript with strict mode
- Follow consistent naming (PascalCase for components, camelCase for props)
- Add JSDoc comments for all props

**Performance**
- Use worklets for UI thread animations
- Minimize state updates during animations
- Test on physical devices

**Documentation**
Every component needs:
- Clear description and video demo
- Complete usage example
- Props documentation with types
- Dependency requirements

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Works on iOS and Android
- [ ] Smooth 60fps animations  
- [ ] Props work as documented
- [ ] TypeScript types correct
- [ ] No memory leaks

## Pull Request Process

1. **Write clear commit messages**
2. **Update documentation if needed**
3. **Test on both platforms**
4. **Include screenshots/videos**

## Quality Standards

New components should:
- Solve real developer problems
- Be performant (60fps)
- Work on both platforms
- Include comprehensive docs
- Follow existing patterns
