import { Accordion, Accordions } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/accordion';

<Accordions type="single">

<Accordion title="Do I need to install these as npm packages?">

No! All components are **self-contained** and designed to be copied directly into your project. Simply copy the component file you want to use, install the required dependencies, and you're ready to go.

This approach gives you full control over the code and makes it easy to customize the components to fit your needs.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Which React Native versions are supported?">

The components work with:
- **React Native** 0.70 or higher
- **Expo SDK** 48 or higher
- **React Native Reanimated** v3+

We recommend using the latest stable versions for the best experience.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I use these components with bare React Native?">

Yes! The components work with both Expo and bare React Native projects. However, you'll need to follow the platform-specific installation guides for the required dependencies:

- [React Native Reanimated](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/fundamentals/getting-started/)
- [React Native Skia](https://shopify.github.io/react-native-skia/docs/getting-started/installation)
- [React Native Gesture Handler](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-gesture-handler/docs/installation)

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Do all components require React Native Skia?">

No, only some components require Skia:

- **AnimatedNumber**: Only requires Reanimated âœ…
- **CircleLoader**: Requires Reanimated + Skia
- **LiquidSwitch**: Requires Reanimated + Skia  
- **ScratchCard**: Requires Reanimated + Skia + Gesture Handler

If you want to avoid Skia, start with AnimatedNumber.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I customize the animations?">

Absolutely! Each component is designed to be customizable:

- **AnimatedNumber**: Supports both timing and spring animations with full config options
- **CircleLoader**: Customize colors, sizes, and timing
- **LiquidSwitch**: Customize colors, sizes, and add custom icons
- **ScratchCard**: Customize overlay and reveal content

Since you have the full source code, you can modify any aspect of the animations.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Are the components TypeScript ready?">

Yes! All components are written in TypeScript with full type definitions. You'll get:

- Complete IntelliSense support
- Type checking for all props
- Proper type inference
- JSDoc documentation for all properties

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I add custom styling?">

Most components accept style props like `containerStyle`, `textStyle`, etc. You can also:

1. **Modify the component directly** since you have the source code
2. **Wrap the component** in your own styled container
3. **Use the provided style props** for common customizations

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I use these in production apps?">

Yes! These components are production-ready and built with performance in mind:

- Uses **Reanimated** for 60fps animations on the UI thread
- **Skia** provides hardware-accelerated graphics
- Minimal dependencies and optimized rendering
- Tested across different devices and screen sizes

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What if I find a bug or want to contribute?">

Since these are copy-paste components, you can:

1. **Fix bugs directly** in your copied version
2. **Report issues** on the GitHub repository
3. **Share improvements** back to the community
4. **Create pull requests** with enhancements

See our [Contributing Guide](/docs/contributing) for more details.
